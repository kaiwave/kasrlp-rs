attempting to implement [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSAOh4L41Wg|kavans atom simulator]] in rust, for learning purposes. 

this is not intended to be a full implementation of the atom simulator, but rather a learning exercise for both rust programming and physics.

below i will link the resources i am using to learn
